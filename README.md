# machine-learning-challenge
UCSD Data Science Bootcamp - Machine Learning Homework

## Purpose
Build practice and confidence with Machine Learning techniques such as clustering and regression testing.

## Premise
Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.
To help process this data, create machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset.

## Timeline
This project will be completed on or before May 1st and will likely not have many updates going forward.
